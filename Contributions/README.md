## :wave: Introduction

The following document gives an overview on how to become a citizen of state.one. 
This means contributing to the project and receiving voting rights (=tokens in the future) for this contribution. 
Everything is hereby transparently tracked via git. Public contributions can be a variety of things, including [research](https://github.com/State-One/State-One/tree/main/Research), marketing and education and aren’t necessarily only focused on the core technology development. 

## :page_facing_up: Guidelines 	

> **:loudspeaker:** The document itself will change over time via contributions. In the future this process should be entirely on-chain and as decentralised as possible.  

In the future all citizens with voting rights have the right to accept any contribution they want as long as it gets the required number of approvals. As long as this is tracked on GitHub only the top [24 citizens](./Citizens.md), according to the number of voting rights, have the right to accept PRs. The citizens should follow these guidelines:
- At the beginning a contribution of **1 hour should be worth roughly 10 voting rights (tokens).** 
- After each distribution of a **multiple of 100.000 voting rights, the amount of tokens distributed per hour is halved.** 

Not all contributions should be rewarded on an hourly rate. It’s possible to make rare exceptions to the above rules, if something is potentially very useful for the project. For example, Amazon offers to implement the stablecoin as a payment solution. 

## :pencil: Process

The below process let’s you either claim voting rights for previous contributions or let’s you negotiate conditions for potential future contributions (similar to contracts/grants). 

### 1. Share (Future) Contribution 

   1. [Fork](https://github.com/State-One/State-One) this repository.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the contirubtion template ([`contirubtions/contirubtion-template.md`](contirubtions/contirubtion-template.md)). Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
   3. Name the new file after your project: `name_contirubtion_number.md`.
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your contirubtion.  
   5. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain _one new file_—the Markdown file you created from the template.
   
### 2. Review

   1. The [citizens of state.one](./Citizens.md) can (and usually do) issue comments and request changes on the pull request.
   2. The contribution will be accepted and merged as soon as one fourth of the citizens with GitHub voting rights accept it (see [citizens of state.one](./Citizens.md), or closed after two weeks of inactivity. 

### 3. Receiving Voting Rights 

If you already finished your contribution in the past, you will receive your voting rights as soon as possible. Initially this requires only an update of the list below by an existing citizen. 

If you promised to do something in the future, you need to update the merged contribution document with another PR, which also needs to be accepted.
